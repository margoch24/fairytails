On the streets are blue and yellow flags and tridents, which protect and care for freedom, and therefore no enemy is able to destroy them.</span>

You will go there and immediately find yourself in the thick shade of trees that emit a fresh aroma. There are also many hills and ravines in our forests, as the terrain here is hilly. <span class="read-more-text" id="read_more_text3"> Near the forest there are swamps, on the shores of which many wild birds live. There are wonderful lakes in our forests. They are located in the middle of the woods, where my father and I often go to rest and fish. The well-being and happiness of my native land are important to me. This is the most expensive place on Earth.</span>
